# Anti-UnveilR-V2

To use:

1. Create and configure a `.env` file with your `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `GUILD_ID`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`

If you just want to test it out (you ain't gonna make a bot with this), you can replace the `SCRIPT_SOURCE()` in [`Template.luau`](src/Template.luau) with a sample script, then obfuscate it on wearedevs.net and use the `.l` command in the Threaded discord server to deobfuscate it.

This might be patched soon with the upcoming V3 release, so don't expect this to last long, use it at your own risk.

However, I'll try my best to keep this updated.
